Note: I can't find where I uploaded my second project log, so I'm recreating it here along with the third.

Project Log for Tuesday, 12-3-19

I've added Sodexo and Fazer classes that parse XML data from the web.  Because Sodexo 
and Fazer have their XML data different format, I had to create separate classes with specific parsing methods.
I've also created a lunchvVew classes which - in theory - will allow me to separate some of my code from the 
TextUI application.  I also discovered that using Restaurant as a common trait between Sodexo and Fazer may allow me to share 
common code between Sodxeo and Fazer.

Methods/functions that work include adding new restaurants, parsing restaurants data and then 
printing restaurants by day and by week, user can print out their favorite restaurant.

I really struggled with parsing JSON data - hours were lost in frustration - and eventually switched
over to XML as it was slightly easier (but still difficult) to work with in Scala.  I am now struggling with
getting filtering to work, as I have fairly messy code that needs a lot of refactoring.

Workload has been about 10 hours per week.  

I feel like I'm schedule. For the next two weeks, I hope to get filtering and favorites to work. 
This may require quite a bit of code refactoring. I may just stay with the text based UI considering 
how much work I still have left.

Project Log, 25-3-19

Project has improved substantially.  Restaurant trait has been added along with implementation of all major methods such as 
filtering food, filtering allergies, finding favorites, and printing out final menus.

I had a lot of trouble getting filtering to work with multiple key terms, as well as building methods that took in user input and fed
them to the corresponding methods (for instance, taking in the user's allergies and filtering them).

15+ hours a week for this round.

I feel actually a bit ahead of schedule given my zero desire to do a GUI form.  As of present, my project is functional.

Project Log, 8-4-19

I've played around with a GUI (both Swing and ScalaFX) and failed entirely.  I could barely get a pop up window to show up.
Tried to refactor some sloppy code (such as the filtering logic) but ran into some deadends.  

Difficulties were with the GUI and were resolved by deciding it wasn't worth the frustration.

5 hours per week.  My patience for GUIs is thin.

I feel still on schedule.  Will spend the remaining week just cleaning up code and preparing the final report!
